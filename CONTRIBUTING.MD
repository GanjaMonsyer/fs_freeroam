## Pull Requests

Otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

- Pull requests will be merged after being reviewed.
- Please be respectful to other contributors and hold to [The Code Manifesto](http://codemanifesto.com/)
